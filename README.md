The repository includes the code solutions for the famous UI Challenges available at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)

The project was built while solving out the challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) to strengthen my primary skills in HTML,CSS and JavaScript while also trying to learn the popular framework [Angluar](https://angular.io/).

I am planning to complete as many challenges as I can. All projects are hosted on Vercel
